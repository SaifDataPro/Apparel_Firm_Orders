# Sparrow Apparels Order Analysis Project

This project analyzes order data from a small Apparel firm that records data in Google Sheets, stored and processed in BigQuery, and visualized using Looker

## Data Sources

*   Google Sheets (for initial data entry)
*   Google BigQuery (for data storage and processing)

## Tools Used

*   Google Sheets
*   Google BigQuery
*   Looker
  
## Assumptions

* The cost of materials, packaging and manhour was kept constant
* Each order has only a specific type of Product associated with it
* Production cost means - cost of material required to fulfill an order, manhour cost to complete all process and cost of packaging material
* The firm uses discounts for high volume orders depending on relatiosnhip with the client, these can be anything between 2-5% of order value

## Business Questions Addressed

* Number of Orders and items by timeframe - Month, Qtr, Year
* Number of Orders and items by Clients, Product Type, size, Packaging
* How much would be the cost of Production for each Product type?
* How much would be the packaging cost for each order?
* How much would be the material required and it’s cost for each order?
* How much time each order requires to be fulfilled?
* How much man-hour would be needed to fulfill each order and the associated cost?
* How much would be the total cost of production for each order end to end?
* Considering the firm wants to keep a margin of 25-30% on it's orders, suggest what selling price should be quoted for each order
* A brief analysis on rejected orders
